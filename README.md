# Quantum-Secure-Deep-Learning
Digital Twin of Quantum Secure deep learning algorithm, based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05629v2
The schematic of the system is as follows:

We simualte the system and calculate:
1. The dot product of the weight matrix $\vec{w}$ and the input matrix $\vec{x}$
2. The information leakage
